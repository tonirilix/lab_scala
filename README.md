A general repository to publish my journey getting involved in scala lang.

# History
Every good trip will have a history. This history may be at the beginning or at the very end of it... The "when" doesn't really matter.

Scala is a language that I wanted to learn a while ago, the goals that is trying to reach are very interesting, however I started to learn Javascript instead and I still think was such a great idea. I truly believe that you have to follow what makes you happy and Javascript was my choice in that time (No regrets at all).

In recent times I've been involved in a really big project which requires to use languages, technologies and frameworks such as angular, nodejs, scala, java, php, mysql, mongodb, memcached, RabbitMQ, Web Sockets, d3, ETL, and lots and lots of client-side javascript. **It's been so much fun!!!**.

I'm always happy to be part of every single piece of a project because I think it makes you a stronger engineer. Of course it's a great idea to have a deep knowledge in something specific but it doesn't hurt at all to know pieces of the whole craziness.

While working in this project I got really interested in take a look and work in the scala section of the project because it's a big challenge everything that involves... So I can't see a better time to start learning scala.

The last time I felt this excited for learning a programming language was when I started to learn Javascript =') and it went so great! so I know this is something good for me to do.

**Let's do it!!!**
